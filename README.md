Simple codes for stochastic block models -- spectral and psudolikelihood methods

Community detection is an important topic in concurrent network science. To generate a network that contains communities,
specific structures of the network are designed in a clever way.

A stochastic block model is a generative model that produces graphs containing communities. The algorithm is based on 
random graphs, and the simplest rule for "stochasticity" is binomial distribution.
